\begin{abstract}
Many agent based models require agents to have an awareness of their local peers. This process requires... Such a parallel algorithm can be accelerated with GPU.... Of which the most common technique is uniform spatial partitioning.

This paper presents implementation techniques for GPU uniform spatial partitioning capable of reducing branch divergence and read scatter. These techniques have been demonstrated in both 2 and 3 dimensions, however could be applied to higher dimensionality implementations. Results collected from this work show a peak improvement of 5x speed up in contrast with the initial technique.
