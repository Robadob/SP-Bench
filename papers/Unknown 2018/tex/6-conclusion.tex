\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The work within this paper has presented two compatible (better word to show they can be combined) optimisations for the accessing of the spatial partitioning data-structure.
      \item Our results show that both individually and combined they out perform an implementation lacking the optimisation in a wide range of problem and neighbourhood sizes (with uniformly/uniform-randomly distributed agents) in two and three dimensions.
      \item The combined approach consistently outperforms or equals performance of the individual optimisations.
      \item The peak improvement in 2D executed in 26.7\% of the runtime of the initial implementation. (300k agents, ~48.0 neighbours)
      \item The peak improvement in 3D executed in 18.6\% of the runtime of the initial implementation. (40k agents, ~46.7 neighbours)
      \item Further research is ongoing investigating the impact of other variables which may affect the performance of \gls{gpu} uniform spatial partitioning and how they affect these optimisations and may lead to further improvements of performance.
