\section{Optimised Binning (requires a better name)\label{sec:innovation}}
  The previous section ... explained the technique of uniform spatial partitioning. In particular this research has concerened itself with optimisation at the stage of acessing bins.
  \textit{Deeper analysis of the binning used by default}

  \subsection{Strips}
    \textit{Describe the modification for strips}

  \subsection{Modular}
    \textit{Describe the modification for modular}

  \subsection{Hybrid}
    \textit{Describe how they combine to further increase the benefits (Even in 2D!)}
    

\section{Results\label{sec:results}}

  \subsection{Static Uniform access}
    \textit{Explanation of how benchmarks were carried out}
  
    \subsubsection{2D}
      \textit{Results}
      \textit{Brief 2D specific explanation}

    \subsubsection{3D}
      \textit{Results}
      \textit{Brief 3D specific explanation}

  \subsection{Physical model}
    \textit{Explanation of how circles benchmarks were carried out, cite Padabs, explain improvements (sin smoothing).}
      \textit{Brief explanation specific to results}

  \subsection{Concluding analysis (of results)}
    \textit{Wider analysis of results citing profiled analysis to explain limitations of this innovation}
