  \IEEEPARstart{M}{any} complex systems have mobile entities located within a continuous space such as: particles, people or vehicles. Typically these systems are represented via \gls{abs} where entities are agents. In order for these mobile agents to decide actions, they must be aware of their neighbouring agents. This awareness is typically provided by fixed radius near neighbours (FRNNs) search, whereby each agent considers the properties of every other agent located within a spatial radial area about their simulated position. This searched area can be considered the agent's neighbourhood and must be searched every timestep of a simulation, ensuring the agent has access to the most recent information about their neighbourhood. In many cases such as flocking, pedestrian interaction and cellular systems, the majority of time is spent performing this neighbourhood search, as opposed to agent logic. It is hence often the primary performance limitation.
  
  The most common technique utilised for accelerating FRNNs is one of uniform spatial partitioning. Within uniform spatial partitioning, the environment is decomposed into a regular grid, partitioned according to the interaction radius. Agents are then stored or sorted according to the grid cell they are located within. Agents consider their neighbourhood by performing a distance test on all agents within their own grid partition and any directly adjacent neighbouring grid cells. This has caused researchers to seek to improve the efficiency of FRNNs handling, primarily by approaching more efficient memory access patterns \cite{GS*10,Hoe14,HY*15}. However without a rigorous standard to compare implementations, exposing their relative benefits is greatly complicated.
