\section{Assessed Frameworks\label{sec:assessed-frameworks}}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
The benchmark implementations assessed within this paper all target execution on a single machine. Care has been taken to follow best practices as expressed in the relevant documentation and examples provided with each framework to ensure that the optimisation of model implementations is appropriate. The associated model implementations are publicly available on this projects repository\footnote{https://github.com/Robadob/circles-benchmark} and further details regarding the frameworks can be found on the OpenAB website\footnote{http://www.openab.org/benchmarks/simulators/}.

The below frameworks have been targeted within this research.
\begin{itemize}
\item Inspired by the FLAME agent-based modelling framework, FLAMEGPU  was developed to utilise GPU computation via a combination of XML and CUDA \cite{RR082}. 
\item MASON is a Java multiagent simulation toolkit capable of executing models with a large numbers of agents on a single machine, providing an additional suite of visualisation tools \cite{LC*04}. 
\item The Repast collective of modelling tools has now been under development for over 15 years. The symphony product targets computation on individual computers and small clusters, facilitating the development of agent-based models using Java and Relogo \cite{repsat2013}.
\end{itemize}
