  The work within this paper has provided formal and standardised specification for the circles benchmark. This benchmark is beneficial for assessing the performance of FRNNs search implementations in response to changes to: problem size, neighbourhood size and entropy. The results within this paper have shown the linear performance relationships of the 3 tested \gls{abs} frameworks in response to changing agent populations and neighbourhoods. This provides a basis for those looking to implement \gls{abs} reliant on FRNNs and a metric to improve FRNNs search implementations. However this work would benefit from expansion to include more frameworks and standalone FRNNs search implementations utilising the most recent research advances.
