\section{Assessed Frameworks\label{sec:assessed-frameworks}}
  The benchmark implementations assessed within all target execution on a single machine. Where appropriate models within this paper have been approved by the relevant parties to assure that their optimisation is appropriate and are available at \textbf{some github repo/OpenAB todo}.
  \subsection{MASON}
    MASON is a Java multiagent simulation toolkit capable of executing models with a large numbers of agents on a single machine across multiple machines. Developed as a joint project between George Mason University's Evolutionary Computation Laboratory and the GMU Center for Social Complexity, MASON was first published by Luke et al in 2003\cite{LB*03}.
  \subsection{FLAME-GPU}
    Inspired by the FLAME agent-based modelling framework, FLAME-GPU was developed to utilise \gls{gpu} computation via a combination of XML and CUDA. FLAME-GPU was first published by Dr Paul Richmond et al at the University of Sheffield\cite{RR08}.
  \subsection{Repast Simphony}
    The Repast collective of modelling tools has now been under development for over 15 years. The symphony product targets computation on individual computers and small clusters, facilitating the development of agent-based models\cite{repast2013}.
