\section{Assessed Frameworks\label{sec:assessed-frameworks}}
  The benchmark implementations assessed within this paper have been approved by the relevant parties to assure that their optimisation is appropriate.
  \subsection{D-Mason}
    D-Mason is a parallel incarnation of the MASON toolkit, capable of executing agent-based simulations across multiple machines. Developed by ISISLab at the University of Salerno D-MASON was first published in 2011\cite{CD*11}.
  \subsection{FLAME-GPU}
    Inspired by the FLAME agent-based modelling framework, FLAME-GPU was developed to utilise \gls{gpu} computation by Dr Paul Richmond at the University of Sheffield\cite{RR08}.
  \subsection{Repast Simphony}
    The Repast collective of modelling tools has now been under development for over 15 years. The symphony product targets individual computers and small clusters facilitating the development of agent-based models\cite{repast2013}.
