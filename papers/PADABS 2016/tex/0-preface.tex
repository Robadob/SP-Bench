%Include why FRNNs is often a limiting factor
Agent based models are concerned with the interaction of independent agents. Central to this interaction is the concept of fixed radius nearest neighbours (FRNNs), providing agents an awareness of their local peers. Due to it's central role, handling of FRNNs is often a limiting factor of performance. However without a standardised metric to assess to the handling of FRNNs, contributions to the field lack the rigorous appraisal necessary to expose their relative benefits.
This paper presents a standardised specification of the circles benchmark, providing a means for the objective assessment of FRNNs performance, to enable the contrasting of implementations.
Supplementary results collected from implementations of three agent-based modelling frameworks show the CPU bound performance to scale linearly with agent population, in contrast the GPU accelerated framework only became linear after maximal device utilisation around 150,000 agents. The performance of each of the assessed frameworks was also found unaffected by changes to the rate of agent movement.
