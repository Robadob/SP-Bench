\chapter{Paper Submitted to AAMAS 2015\label{appendix:a}}
The paper on the following pages was submitted to AAMAS 2015, the work contained within was a condensed version of that produced during my 3rd year undergraduate dissertation with minimal additional work carried out in order to write the paper. The paper was not accepted, however this was partially to be expected due to the prestige nature of AAMAS.

The review summaries from each of the reviewers are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The contribution of the article is not sufficient to be accepted at the AAMAS conference.
  \item No motivation on the need for a new crowd modeling (sic) approach, and poor results on the proposed Attractors and Repulsors method make (sic) unclear the impact and significance of the paper to the field.
  \item The results of this paper are significant and the manuscript is written and organised well.
\end{itemize}
