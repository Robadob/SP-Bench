\chapter{Existing Work\label{chap:literature}}
  The following subsections provide an overview of the field of complex simulations, their primary bottleneck of neighbourhood searches and techniques that are used for handling neighbourhood searches and other spatial challenges. The initial subsection starts by describing a high level overview of complex simulations and their use of spatial data, the later sections then examine the techniques used for handling spatial data and how these techniques can be accelerated through the use of high performance computation. This information provides a grounded view of existing work from which the proposal in chapter \ref{chap:proposal} has been formed. %This work is then utilised and examined in greater detail in the later chapters of this thesis, so that they can be built on.
