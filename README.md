##Report
The `report` directory contains the necessary LaTeX and graphical resources (and windows batch files) to build the report as a pdf file. This will be output to the report directory as `paper.pdf`.

This has been tested using Miktex 2.9, but there are no obvious reasons that other versions shouldn't work. If there are compilation issues, it is likely that the included LaTeX packages are different versions, whereby syntax has changed.
